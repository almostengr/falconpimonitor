# Falcon Pi Monitor

This project contians a set of automated tests that I use to monitor the status of the Falcon Pi Player. 

The reason that this is set up as a standalone project instead of adding it as a script to the Falcon Pi
is because I want it to run if the Falcon Pi were to go offline (i.e. GFCI trips).

## Technology

This project uses C#, Selenium, and NUnit Test Cases.
